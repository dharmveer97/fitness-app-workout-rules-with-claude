# Fitness App - Productivity Setup Guide

## 🚀 Comprehensive Development Environment

You now have a **state-of-the-art productivity setup** combining multiple proven systems for maximum development efficiency with Claude Code.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 1. **Claude Code Agents** (`.claude/agents/`)

Specialized AI agents for specific development tasks:

- **`typescript-architect.md`** - TypeScript type system expert
- **`formik-zod-specialist.md`** - Form validation specialist
- **`code-reviewer.md`** - Multi-perspective code review system

### 2. **Task Master Integration** (`.windsurf/` & `.roo/`)

Advanced project management with task tracking:

- Systematic task breakdown and management
- Rules-based development workflows
- IDE-specific optimizations for VSCode, Windsurf, and Roo

### 3. **Steipete Agent Rules** (Best Practices)

Industry-proven development patterns:

- Multi-perspective code reviews
- Structured commit messages
- Comprehensive quality assurance

## 🛠️ Available Tools & Commands

### Task Master Commands

```bash
task-master list              # View all tasks
task-master next              # Get next priority task
task-master show 1,2,3        # View specific tasks
task-master generate          # Generate task files
task-master research "topic"  # Research with project context
```

### Claude Code Agents

Your agents are automatically triggered based on file patterns and can be manually invoked:

- **TypeScript work**: `typescript-architect` agent activates for `.d.ts` files
- **Form development**: `formik-zod-specialist` agent for form-related files
- **Code reviews**: `code-reviewer` agent provides comprehensive analysis

### Quality Commands

```bash
npm run type-check    # TypeScript validation (auto-triggered)
npm run lint          # ESLint validation
npm run format        # Prettier formatting
```

## 📋 Development Workflow

### 1. **Start a New Feature**

```bash
task-master next              # Get your next task
task-master research "topic"  # Research if needed
```

### 2. **TypeScript Development**

- Create Zod schemas in `/schemas`
- Define types in `/types/*.d.ts` using `import()` syntax
- Let TypeScript Architect agent ensure compliance

### 3. **Form Development**

- Use Formik + Zod pattern enforced by specialist agent
- Follow validation standards automatically

### 4. **Code Review Process**

- Multi-perspective review system (Product, Dev, QE, Security, DevOps, UX)
- Structured feedback with severity ratings
- Action items with specific file references

### 5. **Commit Standards**

```bash
✨ feat(auth): add biometric authentication
🐛 fix(deposits): resolve calculation bug
♻️ refactor(nav): improve navigation structure
⚡️ perf(list): optimize rendering performance
✅ test(forms): add validation tests
```
